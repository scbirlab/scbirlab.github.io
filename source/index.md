# SCBIRLab

We study how pathogenic bacteria survive and infect, using the chemical biology toolbox 
to define bacterial gene functions and explore networks of gene-gene functional interdependencies.

We apply this systems chemical biology approach to understand infection and resistance: 
the resilience of bacterial pathogens during infection processes and their genetic flexibility to 
escape antibiotic challenge.
